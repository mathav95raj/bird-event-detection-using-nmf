Implementation of paper "Masked Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Bird
Detection Using Weakly Labeled Data" by "Iwona Sobieraj, Qiuqiang Kong, Mark D. Plumbley"

Masked NMF was used to learn discriminative dictionaries of bird and non bird Mel spectrogram features from a weakly labeled freefield1010 bird audio dataset. The resultant dictionaries were used to extract  features from test dataset that resulted in an accuracy of 86.3 \% using random forest as classifier
